                Hello! This is really simple game, it's part of Calculus I. The idea behind is that this is an RPG battle. Like from any other RPG, \
                but the damage done to your enemy and heal done to yourself are calculated by functions.
                 \
                NORMAL ATTACK: this attack is calculated by random functions but the input will always be f(5) and the output damage will be the result of the function.
                 \
                ALL OUT ATTACK: this attack is calculated by an inequality with an x. The output will always be x > n, which means that the output damage done will be > x.
                 \
                HEAL: the heal has 75% of actually healing, and a 25% chance of damaging you. It works with a function and x can take a value between 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12. If the number randomly picked is even, the heal will work, healing you the output amount. But, if the number is odd, the work won't heal, and it will actually hurt you.
                Your enemy works exactly like you do, but he always goes all out, except when he finds himself in trouble. Then, he will try to heal. \
                His heal works the same was as you do, so he can heal or kill himself trying.
                Knowing this, good luck! And thank you for playing!""");
